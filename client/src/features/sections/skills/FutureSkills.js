      <p>I could list a few hundred things I plan to learn this decade, but my immediate priority is to learn anything and everything that will make me a more effective team member and employee. High on my priority list are Python, server-side rendering technologies (Next.js), GraphQL, and so, so many others. </p>
      <p>A few other things I might learn in the near future include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using code to create internal and consumer financial products</li>
        <li>Learning how to use artificial intelligence to improve decision making</li>
        <li>Learning blockchain technology and its potential applications</li>
        <li>Mastering a few more spoken languages</li>
