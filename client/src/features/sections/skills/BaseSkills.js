            <SkillItem skillType="HTML/CSS" level="9">
                Extensive experience using HTML and CSS, including many advanced concepts. I'm also great at optimizing pages for small screens. I have not yet fully optimized this site for mobile, however üòê It's coming soon.
            </SkillItem>
            <SkillItem skillType="React" level="4">
                I am relatively new with React but have a firm grasp of the technology (this site was created using React). I know the latest API features and have used various common libraries, including react-router-dom, which is used extensively on this site. I will no doubt gain a lot more advanced knowledge over the coming months.
            </SkillItem>
            <SkillItem skillType="Redux" level="4">
                Like with React, my experience with Redux is relatively recent but growing. I have used it for managing application state, and have implemented many of its modern features including those included in Redux Toolkit (e.g., RTK Query). I am gaining more experience with Redux every day.
            </SkillItem>
            <SkillItem skillType="JavaScript" level="8">
                I have extensive knowledge of JavaScript, from many of its most modern features to some of its older, now-obsolete features (useful for understanding legacy code, perhaps). My recent use of JavaScript has centered much around Node development.
            </SkillItem>
            <SkillItem skillType="APIs" level="4">
                My understanding is solid but my experience is incomplete. I have some experience using and creating REST APIs, but I have room to learn things in greater depth. I have used Express and have a basic knowledge of authentication and security concerns, including the use of Express middlewares.
            </SkillItem>
            <SkillItem skillType="Databases" level="7">
                I love databases (perhaps it reflects my love for data in general). I have a decent amount of experience designing stable and efficient tables, and using SQL to find exactly what I need. I have been using PostgreSQL recently, but I also have much past experience using MySQL. I have much to learn to fully master many of the most advanced features, but I have already had a pretty good start.
            </SkillItem>
            <SkillItem skillType="Algorithms" level="5">I have earned 6 / 6 stars for Problem Solving (i.e., Algorithms) on HackerRank. There's still much to learn, but I think I have a lot of the basics down. I can create algorithms that are efficient in runtime and memory use.</SkillItem>
