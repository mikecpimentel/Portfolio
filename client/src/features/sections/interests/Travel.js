      <p>Because my childhood was miserable and deeply unstable, I had always dreamed of going far, far away, regardless of whether I had the means to do so.</p>
      <p>My solo explorations at home and abroad have had a profound impact on my growth as a person.</p>
      <p>A few of the countries I have thus far been fortunate to have been to explore include:</p>
      <ul className="travel-list">

        <li>South Korea</li>
        <li>Japan</li>
        <li>Taiwan</li>
        <li>Hong Kong</li>
