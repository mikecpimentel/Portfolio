            <p>Production Period: Aug 2012 to Feb 2013; Feb 2015 to Jan 2016

WHAT:
Collabolist was my attempt at creating a quicker, simpler, and more convenient alternative to Excel for list creation.

WHY:
As I worked at TransPerfect, I once again felt the frustration and inefficiency of Excel spreadsheets. Much time was wasted waiting for unwieldy Excel files to sync and open as TransPerfect created lists of all kinds using spreadsheets. Collabolist was my attempt at a solution.

HOW:
Just like with Geller Portal, I worked on Collabolist every hour I was not at work. I already spent 12 hours a day either at work or sitting on the subway to and from work, so Collabolist took up virtually every hour of my free time at home. Fortunately, I had just recently finished work on Geller Portal, so programming was still fresh in my mind.

This was one of my most complex projects. Just like with Let's Ask Bobby and Geller Portal, I used AJAX extensively with Collabolist to enable functionality without needing to refresh the browser page.

I discovered the Notepad++ app while developing this project, which was a huge upgrade from the basic Notepad.

About a year ago, I discovered the online app Airtable and have been a huge evangelist of the service ever since. It is everything I wanted Collabolist to be.</p>
