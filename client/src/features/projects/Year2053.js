            <p>This is Year 2053 stuff</p>
            <p>Production Period: Sept 2016 to Jan 2018
Technologies Used: Java, SQLite, Android Studio, Audacity, Photoshop
WHAT:
Year 2053 was a text-based choose-your-own-adventure-type text game complete with background sound effects and voice acting (myself doing all the voice acting). Every single choice the user makes in the game affects the story

This was my one and only foray into Android development.

WHY:
It seemed like a fun project to work on while I was going through difficult times.

HOW:
There were so many challenging components to this project that I had to overcome.

One was performance testing and having to learn all sorts of tools to help me identify sources of lag.  I wanted the app to run as smoothly as possible, even on older devices.

My favorite part of this project was figuring out how to program the evolving nature of the story, where user choices in the past either redirect or add components to future storylines. I had to dynamically (and seamlessly) connect over a hundred different audio files in different orders and patterns depending on choices made in the past.

The story-making process was also pretty complex, especially with all the diverging and intersecting storylines. I made huge online diagrams to help me connect all the pieces.

Another interesting challenge was developing the functions that enabled the audio and text to sync up perfectly.

I learned a lot about audio recording and especially editing. I recorded the audio in a freezing-cold car (through the Indiana wintertime), which was the closest thing to a studio I could find (I mean, without spending money that I didn't have).

I was very happy with the end product.

I used Android Studio (a free Google Android IDE) for this project. It was the first time I used something more complex than a simple text editor for coding.</p>
