            <p>This is WordPress Tinkerings stuff</p>
            <p>Production Period: Mar 2019 to Apr 2020
Technologies Used: WordPress, Elementor, PHP, CSS, HTML, Photoshop, Illustrator, Google Analytics, Ahrefs, and many others
WHAT:
Some of the projects I started (among several others not listed) include:

MapFroth - A travel site and my first WordPress site. Most of my time was spent experimenting with different plugins and attempting to understand very basic UX/UI concepts.
The Benjamin Hacker - A personal finance site. I discussed topics such as the stock market, savings, credit, and other financial topics I was fascinated with.
BlogFinch - A site which helped people understand web concepts such as cPanel, WordPress, hosting, domains, plugins, etc. Its purpose was to help explain concepts that I had only recently mastered. I felt I was in a good position to explain things since the learning experience was still fresh in my mind.
GrowMike - A personal growth and development site. It contained articles on a diverse array of topics including personal finance, travel, productivity and the like.
Every single project improved my WordPress development skills and the speed at which I produced results.

None of these websites are online anymore. I took the sites down because I couldn't afford all the web hosting, but I still wanted to experiment with new website ideas. I still possess backups and files for each.

WHY:
I discovered WordPress in 2019. Although I had heard of it before, I had not the slightest idea of what it was other than a way of making websites.

I spent the next two years, and thousands of hours, mastering the ins and outs of the technology, including the use of many specialized plugins. This was my first time using such a platform.

The years spent learning WordPress have helped deepen my understanding of the ins and outs of the modern internet.

HOW:
A few of the major topics I learned with these projects include:

How to use WordPress, of course
Content writing and editing
How to quickly, but exhaustively, research new topics
How to create web graphics (e.g., sourcing graphic components, using Illustrator, etc.)
Basic project management and the ability to hold myself accountable to certain self-imposed deadlines
How to effectively organize massive amounts of information.
Legal topics (e.g., image licensing, copyrights, privacy, etc.)
Web security (e.g., firewalls, Cloudflare, TLS, etc.)
Web performance (e.g., CDNs, image optimization, caching, etc.)
UX/UI (e.g., simple and logical site navigation, white space, color theory, font-size ratios, responsive web design, etc.)
Search engine optimization (e.g., the ideal use of HTML elements, the use of schema, image indexing, search engine indexing, keyword research, website structuring, etc.)
Web analytics (e.g., web-traffic monitoring and analysis, search engine monitoring, tagging, conversion tracking, etc.)
I also took a deep dive into many specialized subjects in order to write compelling articles.

As with all my projects in the past, nothing was learned through structured courses, online or otherwise. I relied exclusively off of free online articles, books, and direct observation for my education on all the various topics.

During this time, I also read countless books on marketing principles, time management, productivity, business management, and others.

The skills I gained with these projects (and the two projects after these) allowed me to quickly create this portfolio site.</p>

WHAT:
DiaperPiper is a parenting website that offers quality information on various parenting-related topics. It also has a product directory for baby diapers and baby wipes, with each wipes page explaining the function and use of each ingredient it contains.

DiaperPiper is still running and can be found at https://diaperpiper.com. I have not, however, added new articles in months.

WHY:
Although I am not a parent, I thought that DiaperPiper would be a somewhat interesting project to work on. At the very least, I figured it would prepare me for future parenthood, whenever that might come.

HOW:
DiaperPiper continued to improve my understanding and abilities with WordPress development.

With this project, I spent a great deal of time tinkering with different design elements, attempting to capture a more professional feel. I really wanted to create a site that was easy to navigate, comfortable to read, and easy to understand. I also took enormous care in developing a system for vetting products. I truly spent an inordinate amount of time researching each and every category of products (weeks, even) in order to provide the most thorough information possible.

WHAT
I created Omaha Cookie Co. as an online-only cookie shop specializing in premium cookies.

I took the site down in order to focus my time elsewhere. The system, however, is ready to go at a moment's notice (and I still have like 200 pounds of ingredients stored in heavy-duty boxes). Once I find full-time employment, I'll likely bake the cookies and donate them.

WHY
I enjoy cooking and baking. Making cookies seemed like an interesting thing to try.

HOW
I developed the recipes using only high-quality ingredients, including cage-free organic eggs, organic flour, sprouted organic oats, and sweet cream butter toasted over the stove.

Just like with all my other projects, I performed all tasks and development myself.

A few of the things I did for this project were:

Create an ingredient-management and costing system to perfectly account for per-cookie and per-unit costs.
Create a nutrition facts system to easily generate detailed nutrition information for each cookie or product.
Design the website, packaging, emails and other materials.
Implement the sales, tracking, and notification systems.
Source all of the food and packaging materials.
I fine-tuned each recipe down to the gram level and learned the science and chemistry behind each ingredient.

I baked over a thousand cookies to create just the right recipes and to calibrate the bake times for each cookie type down to the second. I had a super cheap oven, so there was little margin for error.
